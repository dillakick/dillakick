### 👋 Hi! // こんにちは！ // ¡Hola!

Hi there! My name is nxm3, otherwise known as "Zeroworld", or "Lua," or "WhatIsTheName"
I know a *lot* of Python, Lua, HTML, and CSS (and now Small Basic :D).

I have a Github organization that's basically a place for me to make stuff for brick-building games (Won't be exactly Roblox, or Finobe). [Check it out right here!](https://github.com/lakemichiganindustries)

I also have a Neocities site (you may laugh now): https://lockdownlua.neocities.org/
