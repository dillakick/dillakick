### 👋 Hi! // こんにちは！ // ¡Hola!

Hi there! My name is dillakick, otherwise known as "Zeroworld", or "Lua."
I know a *lot* of Python, Lua, HTML, CSS, Small Basic (and now PHP :D).

I have a Github organization that's basically a place for me to make stuff for brick-building games (Won't be exactly Roblox, or Finobe). [Check it out right here!](https://github.com/chicagoskyline)

My website: [lockdownlua.neocities.org](https://lockdownlua.neocities.org)
